# Advanced Hello World

This is the repo for my article
[Hello World a Full Tutorial](https://codeandchaos.com/coding/typescript/2019-09-12-Hello-World/)

Yes, this is a totally over-engineered Hello World Application.

The goal was not to learn about TypeScript and how to use it - but actually how to set up everything around it.
This example concerns itself with best practices and topics that are common in application development:

* Using TypeScript instead of JavaScript
* Setting up NPM Scripts
* Testing your code
* Enforcing Code Style by using a code linter
* Basic i18n support (as adding i18n later may be very difficult)

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Builds and executes the program

### `npm run build`
Compiles the source TypeScript files to JavaScript

### `npm test`
Runs the Jest Tests
